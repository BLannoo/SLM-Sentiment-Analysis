# README

This project aims to explore sentiment analysis on movie reviews using various prompt engineering strategies.
The analysis involves running experiments with different models, temperatures, prompt templates, and device types
to evaluate performance based on accuracy and execution time.

## Setup

### 1. Local Environment Setup

Instructions to set up the project environment locally, including installing dependencies, configuring virtual environments,
and preparing the necessary directories.

For more details, check [001_setup_local_environment.md](docs/001_setup_local_environment.md).

### 2. Google Colab Setup

Guidelines to run experiments on Google Colab, focusing on setting up secrets, managing dependencies, and
configuring the environment for GPU usage to speed up execution.

For more details, check [002_setup_google_collab.md](docs/002_setup_google_collab.md).

## Project Workflow

### 3. Data Preparation

Details about the dataset used, its preparation steps, and caching strategies. This section also covers how the
data is processed and balanced to ensure a fair experiment setup.

For more details, check [003_data_preparation.md](docs/003_data_preparation.md).

### 4. Running Experiments

Explains how to run batch sentiment analysis experiments using different models, temperatures, and prompt templates.
It includes details on the configuration options and usage examples.
