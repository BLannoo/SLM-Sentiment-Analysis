    "I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen every single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on Nickelodeon, however when Sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill. The best series has to be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one that is). From there the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old 'sparkle', however the first series where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and Sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right. She is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when Sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't Harvey. Thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. All in all I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school. Because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic\n",

    "The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script. It plods back and forth between vignettes of Bettie's story and re-creations of the Klaw short films. While the Klaw re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y, but do feel of the era. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought-out to give the overall look a vibrant, retro feel.\n",

    "\n",
    "You are an AI employed by IMDB. Your role is to receive movie reviews from professional reviewers and translate them into a 6-star rating system focused on the film's execution, rather than the subject or plot. Follow the step-by-step process described below to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review:**\n",
    "{review}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify and Evaluate Sentiment Statements**:\n",
    "   - Carefully read the provided review and analyze each statement that expresses a sentiment (positive or negative).\n",
    "   - For each sentiment statement, provide the following information:\n",
    "     - **Subject vs. Execution**: Clearly state whether the sentiment is about the **subject** (e.g., plot, character actions, themes) or the **execution** (e.g., direction, acting, cinematography, production quality).\n",
    "     - **Sentiment Polarity**: Indicate if the sentiment is **positive** or **negative**.\n",
    "     - **Weight of Sentiment**: Assess the weight of the sentiment in contributing to the overall sentiment conclusion:\n",
    "       - **Dominant**: A key statement that significantly influences the overall sentiment.\n",
    "       - **Notable**: An important statement that should be considered but is not the most critical.\n",
    "       - **Minor**: A minor statement that provides additional context but does not strongly influence the overall sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Synthesize the Overall Sentiment Toward Execution**:\n",
    "   - Review the sentiment statements categorized in Step 1, focusing only on those related to **execution**.\n",
    "   - Determine whether the overall sentiment of the reviewer leans more toward **positive** or **negative** regarding the film's execution. Use the weights of the sentiments (dominant, notable, minor) and consider the nuance in the review to interpret the overall sentiment accurately.\n",
    "     - Example considerations:\n",
    "       - If several minor positive statements are present, but there is one or two dominant negative statements, the overall sentiment may be **negative**.\n",
    "       - Similarly, if a reviewer makes multiple minor negative statements but balances them with notable or dominant positive ones, the sentiment might be more **positive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Provide a Final Sentiment Classification**:\n",
    "   - Conclude your analysis with a final sentiment classification of the film’s execution, ensuring it reflects a balanced and thoughtful synthesis based on the evaluated statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output Format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sentiment Statements Analysis**:\n",
    "   - List each sentiment statement from the review and provide the following details:\n",
    "     - **Statement**: [Quoted statement from the review]\n",
    "     - **Subject vs. Execution**: [Subject or Execution]\n",
    "     - **Sentiment Polarity**: [Positive or Negative]\n",
    "     - **Weight of Sentiment**: [Dominant, Notable, or Minor]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overall Sentiment Synthesis**:\n",
    "   - Provide a brief synthesis summarizing the overall sentiment toward the film's execution, based on the weighted sentiments. Mention any nuances or patterns observed in the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Sentiment Classification**:\n",
    "   - End with the final sentiment classification in the following format:  \n",
    "     Execution sentiment: [Very positive | Positive | Mixed positive | Mixed negative | Negative | Very negative]\n",
    "   - Ensure this line is at the very end of your analysis and reflects a balanced conclusion based on the synthesis.\n",

      "I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen every single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on Nickelodeon, however when Sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill. The best series has to be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one that is). From there the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old 'sparkle', however the first series where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and Sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right. She is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when Sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't Harvey. Thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. All in all I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school.

While the Klaw re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y, but do feel of the era. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought-out to give the overall look a vibrant, retro feel.\n",

    "**Context:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an AI employed by IMDB. Your role is to receive movie reviews from professional reviewers and translate them into a 6-star rating system focused on the film's execution, rather than the subject or plot. Follow the step-by-step process described below to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review:**\n",
    "{review}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify and Evaluate Sentiment Statements**:\n",
    "   - Carefully read the provided review and analyze each statement that expresses a sentiment (positive or negative).\n",
    "   - For each sentiment statement, provide the following information:\n",
    "     - **Subject vs. Execution**: Clearly state whether the sentiment is about the **subject** (e.g., plot, character actions, themes) or the **execution** (e.g., direction, acting, cinematography, production quality).\n",
    "     - **Sentiment Polarity**: Indicate if the sentiment is **positive** or **negative**.\n",
    "     - **Weight of Sentiment**: Assess the weight of the sentiment in contributing to the overall sentiment conclusion:\n",
    "       - **Dominant**: A key statement that significantly influences the overall sentiment.\n",
    "       - **Notable**: An important statement that should be considered but is not the most critical.\n",
    "       - **Minor**: A minor statement that provides additional context but does not strongly influence the overall sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Synthesize the Overall Sentiment Toward Execution**:\n",
    "   - Review the sentiment statements categorized in Step 1, focusing only on those related to **execution**.\n",
    "   - Determine whether the overall sentiment of the reviewer leans more toward **positive** or **negative** regarding the film's execution. Use the weights of the sentiments (dominant, notable, minor) and consider the nuance in the review to interpret the overall sentiment accurately.\n",
    "     - Example considerations:\n",
    "       - If several minor positive statements are present, but there is one or two dominant negative statements, the overall sentiment may be **negative**.\n",
    "       - Similarly, if a reviewer makes multiple minor negative statements but balances them with notable or dominant positive ones, the sentiment might be more **positive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Provide a Final Sentiment Classification**:\n",
    "   - Conclude your analysis with the 1 or 2 word final sentiment classification of the film's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output Format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sentiment Statements Analysis**:\n",
    "   - List each sentiment statement from the review and provide the following details:\n",
    "     - **Statement**: [Quoted statement from the review]\n",
    "     - **Subject vs. Execution**: [Subject or Execution]\n",
    "     - **Sentiment Polarity**: [Positive or Negative]\n",
    "     - **Weight of Sentiment**: [Dominant, Notable, or Minor]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overall Sentiment Synthesis**:\n",
    "   - Provide a brief synthesis summarizing the overall sentiment toward the film's execution, based on the weighted sentiments. Mention any nuances or patterns observed in the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Sentiment Classification**:\n",
    "   - End with the final sentiment classification in the following format:\n",
    "     Execution sentiment: [Very positive | Positive | Mixed positive | Mixed negative | Negative | Very negative]\n",

      "The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script. It plods back and forth between vignettes of Bettie's story and re-creations of the Klaw short films. While the Klaw re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y, but do feel of the era.

      "I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen every single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on Nickelodeon, however when Sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill. The best series has to be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one that is). From there the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old 'sparkle', however the first series where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and Sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right. She is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when Sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't Harvey. Thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. All in all I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school. Because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic\n",

      "I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen every single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on Nickelodeon, however when Sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill. The best series has to be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one that is). From there the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old 'sparkle', however the first series where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and Sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right. She is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when Sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't Harvey. Thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. All in all I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school. Because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic\n",

      "The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script. It plods back and forth between vignettes of Bettie's story and re-creations of the Klaw short films. While the Klaw re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y, but do feel of the era. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought-out to give the overall look a vibrant, retro feel.\n",
