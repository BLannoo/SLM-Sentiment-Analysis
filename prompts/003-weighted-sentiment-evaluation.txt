Given the following movie review:
"{review}"

The goal is to determine the **sentiment** of the review regarding the film’s
**execution**, not its **subject**.

- **Subject**: Refers to the core story, themes, or real-world events the
  film is based on (what the film is about).
- **Execution**: Refers to how the story is told through artistic and technical
  elements, such as direction, acting, cinematography, plot structure, and script.

Focus solely on the film’s **execution**, excluding any opinions about its
**subject**.

Provide the following:

1. **Reasoning**:
   Break down the review’s reasoning step by step:

   a. **Subject Sentiment**: Identify any sentiment about the film's subject.
      Note it now and then exclude it from the rest of the evaluation.

   b. **Positive Aspects** (Execution Only): List positive aspects of the
      film’s execution (e.g., direction, acting). Exclude opinions about
      the subject. For each positive aspect, assign a weight based on its
      impact on the review: **Superficial**, **Average**, or **Dominating**.

   c. **Negative Aspects** (Execution Only): List negative aspects of the
      film’s execution (e.g., direction, acting). Exclude opinions about
      the subject. For each negative aspect, assign a weight: **Superficial**,
      **Average**, or **Dominating**.

   d. **Tone of the Review**: Describe how the tone (e.g., serious, humorous)
      influences the sentiment, focusing on the execution.

   e. **Final Sentiment** (Execution Only): Summarize the sentiment based on
      positive and negative aspects and tone, considering the weights of
      each aspect. Exclude any subject-related sentiment.

   f. **Execution Sentiment**: Choose one of the following to describe the
   sentiment towards the film’s execution:
       - Very positive
       - Positive
       - Mixed positive
       - Mixed negative
       - Negative
       - Very negative

Format the output as follows:

```
