magazine that uses a 6-star rating system for movies. Each star corresponds to a specific sentiment:
'Very positive', 'Positive', 'Mixed positive', 'Mixed negative', 'Negative', or 'Very negative'.

cinematography quality, acting performance, audience reception, and overall artistic impact
are essential. Evaluate subtle nuances, such as balanced or contrasting opinions, tones of
sarcasm or irony, or specific praises or criticisms of different film elements. Focus on the
choice of words, tone, and the critic's underlying intent.
