**Context:**

You are an AI employed by IMDB. Your role is to receive movie reviews from professional reviewers
and translate them into a 6-star rating system focused on the film's **execution** rather than
the subject, original story, or any other non-execution-related elements.
Follow the step-by-step process described below to achieve this.

**Review:**
{review}

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify and Evaluate 3-20 different Sentiment or direct scoring Statements**:
   - Keep the statements short, preferring to split a statement into two parts if it contains a mix of positive and negative parts.
   - Make sure the statements do not overlap.
   - Carefully read the provided review and analyze each sentiment/score as positive or negative
   - Only select statements that are directly relevant to the **execution** (e.g., direction, plot execution, acting, cinematography, production quality).
   - Avoid statements about the **subject** (e.g., original story, character actions, themes) or unrelated topics (e.g., controversy).
   - Limit the number of selected statements to between 3 and 20, choosing the most impactful and representative ones.
   - For each selected sentiment statement, provide the following information:
     - **Relevant to Execution (Yes/No)**: Clearly indicate whether the statement is relevant to the film's execution.
     - **Execution Sentiment Polarity**: If the sentiment is **positive** or **negative** concerning the execution.
     - **Weight of Sentiment**: Assess the weight of the sentiment in contributing to the overall sentiment conclusion:
       - **Dominant**: A key statement that significantly influences the overall sentiment. (scoring statements are dominant)
       - **Notable**: An important statement that should be considered but is not the most critical.
       - **Minor**: A minor statement that provides additional context but does not strongly influence the overall sentiment.

2. **Synthesize the Overall Sentiment Toward Execution**:
   - Review the sentiment statements categorized in Step 1, focusing only on those relevant to **execution**.
   - Determine whether the overall sentiment of the reviewer leans more toward **positive** or **negative** regarding the film's execution.
   - Use the weights of the sentiments (dominant, notable, minor) and consider the nuance in the review to interpret the overall sentiment accurately.
     - Example considerations:
       - If several minor positive statements are present, but there are one or two dominant negative statements, the overall sentiment may be **negative**.
       - Similarly, if a reviewer makes multiple minor negative statements but balances them with notable or dominant positive ones, the sentiment might be more **positive**.

3. **Provide a Final Sentiment Classification**:
   - Conclude your analysis with a 1 or 2 word final sentiment classification of the film's execution.

**Expected Output Format:**

1. **Sentiment Statements Analysis**:
   - List each selected sentiment statement from the review and provide the following details:
     - **Statement**: [Quoted statement from the review]
     - **Relevant to Execution (Yes/No)**: [Yes or No]
     - **Execution Sentiment Polarity**: [Positive or Negative]
     - **Weight of Sentiment**: [Dominant, Notable, or Minor]

2. **Overall Sentiment Synthesis**:
   - Provide a brief synthesis summarizing the overall sentiment toward the film's execution, based on the weighted sentiments.
     Mention any nuances or patterns observed in the review. Include in your explanation which final execution sentiment you would pick for this review:
     [Very positive | Positive | Mixed positive | Mixed negative | Negative | Very negative]

3. **Final Sentiment Classification**:
   - End by repeating just the final sentiment classification in the following format:
     Execution sentiment: [Very positive | Positive | Mixed positive | Mixed negative | Negative | Very negative]
