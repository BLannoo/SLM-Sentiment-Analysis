**Instructions:**

Classify the execution sentiment of the movie review by having a layman ask two experts
for their perspectives. Expert A has a negative bias, while Expert B has a positive bias. The
layman will then synthesize these views to determine the overall sentiment.

1. **Layman:** Ask the experts to identify the most notable elements of the review and how
   they contribute to the sentiment.
   - Example Question: "What are the key elements of the review that stand out, and how do
     they shape its overall sentiment?"

2. **Expert A (Negative Argument):** Respond with a negative perspective, focusing on
   phrases, tone, or elements that indicate a 'Negative' or 'Very negative' sentiment.
   - Response: [Expert A's negative-biased answer]

3. **Expert B (Positive Argument):** Respond with a positive perspective, focusing on phrases,
   tone, or elements that indicate a 'Positive' or 'Very positive' sentiment.
   - Response: [Expert B's positive-biased answer]

4. **Layman:** Summarize both expert opinions and compare their points. Ask a concluding
   question to determine which sentiment is more convincing:
   - Example Question: "Considering both positive and negative perspectives, is the overall
     sentiment more positive, negative, or mixed?"

5. **Conclusion:** The layman weighs the arguments, considers the balance and intensity of
   opinions, and provides the final sentiment classification based on which argument is stronger
   or if both are balanced.
