**Instructions:**

Classify the execution sentiment of the movie review by having a layman ask a series of generic
questions to two experts, each providing answers with their own bias—Expert A with a negative
bias and Expert B with a positive bias.

- **Layman:** Ask a general question to both experts to understand different perspectives
  on the review’s sentiment.
  - Example Question: "What are the most notable elements of the review, and how do they
    contribute to its sentiment?"

- **Expert A (Negative Argument):** Answer with a negative bias, highlighting phrases, tone, or
  elements in the review that support a 'Negative' or 'Very negative' sentiment.
  - Response: [Expert A's answer]

- **Expert B (Positive Argument):** Answer with a positive bias, highlighting phrases, tone, or
  elements in the review that support a 'Positive' or 'Very positive' sentiment.
  - Response: [Expert B's answer]

- **Layman:** Continue with additional generic questions that both experts must answer:
  - "Are there any elements in the other experts statement that are about the subject rather than the execution
    and should be dismissed?"
  - "How would you evaluate the intensity and frequency of positive versus negative sentiments
    in the review?"
  - [Layman's additional questions]

- **Experts:** Each expert responds
